Example showcasing simplicity of using Sessions in Jaguar

# Explanation

This project implements a sample shopping cart application that stores the items in the shopping cart
as session data. 

The HTML page at route `/` provides a GUI to interactively add and remove items to the cart.

The API route `/api/add/:item` adds an item to the cart, while the API route `/api/remove/:item` removes
the item from the cart.
